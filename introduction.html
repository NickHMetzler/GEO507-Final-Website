        <h2>Why choose Duntroon?</h2>
        <p>For the past eighteen years, I have had the privilege of living in two vastly different cities: Toronto and Ottawa. Although both of these cities provided me with an abundance of resources and opportunities, my experience living in a small rural community like Duntroon has been significantly different. Duntroon is a rural community with limited services, and most of the people in the area rely on wells and natural gas tanks, since there is no access to city services. Everyone has a vehicle, or borrows one from family due to a lack of public transportation. Housing prices are also inflated due to wealthy people moving in from Toronto, and a lack of available housing.
            <br><br>
            When I read about the Eight Domains of Wellbeing, I knew that I wanted to use my own experience in Duntroon to demonstrate the importance of this concept. I chose to focus on the Education and Living Standards Domains of Wellbeing, as I believe that these are the most important for the people of Duntroon. I believe that living in a smaller rural community has shown me the importance of these domains and how they can be used to shape the future of the community and communities just like this. Education is especially important in a rural setting, as it is the key to providing people with the necessary skills to survive and thrive in their environment. Living standards are also critical, as they provide people with the basic needs and comforts to live a comfortable life.

            My experience in Duntroon has shown me the importance of these two domains of wellbeing and how they can be used to shape the future of a community. Education is essential for providing people with the skills necessary to propel their future, and living standards are a critical factor for providing people with basic necessities and comforts. My experience in Duntroon has made me more aware of the impact that these two domains have on the wellbeing of a community, and I am eager to use this knowledge to help shape the future of these rural communities if possible.
