        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Access to education is crucial for the wellbeing of individuals and communities, and it is essential to ensure that all students have the opportunity to pursue their academic and professional goals. In Duntroon, improving access to education can be achieved by implementing a reliable and affordable bus route to Barrie from the rural communities in and around Duntroon.
            <br><br>
            Investing in a bus route that connects Duntroon to Barrie will provide rural students with access to post-secondary education and job opportunities in Barrie, which is currently difficult to access due to the limited availability of public transportation. This investment will enable students to pursue their academic and professional aspirations without relying on personal transportation, which can be costly and difficult to access for many families in the area.
            <br><br>
            Another recommendation is to prioritize remote learning options for university students. Given the challenges associated with commuting to universities in Orillia and Toronto, providing access to online courses and virtual learning platforms can help rural students access higher education without leaving their communities. Remote learning can also be a viable option during winter weather conditions, when schools and transportation services may be disrupted.
            <br><br>
            In conclusion, improving access to education in Duntroon can be achieved by investing in a reliable and affordable bus route to Barrie and prioritizing remote learning options for university students. These recommendations can help ensure that all students have the opportunity to pursue their academic and professional goals, regardless of their location or financial situation.

        <h2>Living Standards</h2>
        <p>The Living Standards Domain of Wellbeing encompasses various factors, including adequate housing, access to affordable and quality food, and access to transportation. The living standards of a rural community such as Duntroon, Ontario, can have significant impacts on the wellbeing of its residents.
            <br><br>
            Duntroon is primarily a farming community, but it also houses many wealthy older Toronto residents who have moved to the area or purchased vacation homes. As a result, housing prices in the area are similar to those in Toronto, due to the supply sometimes higher, making it challenging for residents with low incomes to find affordable and adequate housing. Most of the residents of Duntroon live and work on generational family farms or work low-wage jobs in the local towns such as Stayner and Collingwood. The high housing costs and the low wages for many of the jobs in the area can make it difficult for residents to afford suitable housing.
            <br><br>
            The limited job options in Duntroon and the surrounding areas also result in many people working seasonal jobs, such as ski lift operators, ski/snowboard instructors, resort staff, servers, mechanics, and more. Seasonal jobs can make it difficult to find stable employment, which can negatively impact living standards.
            <br><br>
            Access to affordable and quality food can also impact living standards, and Duntroon has limited choices for grocery stores. The closest Costco is 45 minutes away in Barrie, which can be a significant inconvenience for residents.
            <br><br>
            Lastly, limited transportation options in Duntroon can make it challenging for residents to access essential services or employment opportunities. The community relies on personal vehicles to travel to places, making them a necessity. This reliance on personal vehicles can have significant financial impact on individuals and families.
